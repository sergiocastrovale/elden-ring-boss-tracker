            <h3 class="font-semibold text-md mb-2">What's this?</h3>
            <p>This is a tracker for the bosses you have defeated in Elden Ring (including the Shadow of the Erdtree
              DLC). In total, this game features 272 + 62 bosses, and keeping track of all events is pretty much
              impossible. Hopefully this tool will help you navigate the game a bit better without spoiling away any
              progression.</p>
            <p>I was looking for an excuse to do a "dev speedrun" of sorts by building a very small app as quickly as
              possible. As I was playing Elden Ring at the time, this seemed like a quick - but useful - project to work
              on.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, as it is customary, I got excited with the project and kept on adding features ðŸ¤·</p>
            <h3 class="font-semibold text-md mb-2 mt-5">Aren't there better tools?</h3>
            <p>It's common knowledge that <a href="https://mapgenie.io/elden-ring" target="_blank"
                class="underline">MapGenie's tools</a> are incredibly useful are incredibly useful - in Elden Ring and
              so many other games. However, the one I use the most - the Boss Checklist - is capped at a maximum of 40
              free locations; after that you'd have to pay.</p>
            <p>This tracker uses the same information as that tracker, but without any limitations. It still links to
              MG's maps and wiki, but you can check and uncheck at will.</p>

            <h3 class="font-semibold text-md mb-2 mt-5">Caveats</h3>
            <p>This tool uses your browser's Local Storage - which means, the list is only stored in your browser. As
              such, there's no login or multi-device sync whatsoever and everything is saved in the machine/browser
              you're interacting with.</p>

            <p>Keep in mind that if you clear cookies and local storage in said browser, you will lose all your tracked
              progress.</p>
