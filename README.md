# Elden Ring Boss Tracker

This is a tracker for the bosses you have defeated in Elden Ring (including the Shadow of the Erdtree
DLC). In total, this game features 272 + 62 bosses, and keeping track of all events is pretty much
impossible. Hopefully this tool will help you navigate the game a bit better without spoiling away any
progression.

This tool leverages MapGenie's resources but removes tracking limits.

You can use it at <https://elden-ring-boss-tracker.vercel.app/>.

## Why did you build this?

I was looking for an excuse to do a "dev speedrun" of sorts by building a very small app as quickly as possible. I built this in about six hours (parser included). As I was playing Elden Ring at the time, this seemed like a quick - but useful - project to work on.

## Aren't there better tools?

Yes! It's common knowledge that [MapGenie's tools](https://mapgenie.io/elden-ring) are incredibly useful - in Elden Ring and so many other games.
However, the one I use the most - the Boss Checklist - is capped at a maximum of 40 free locations; after that you'd have to pay.

This tracker uses the same information as that tracker, but without any limitations. It still links to MG's maps and wiki, but you can check and check at will.

## Caveats

This tool uses your browser's Local Storage - which means, the list is only stored in your browser. As such, there's no login or multi-device sync whatsoever and everything is saved in the machine/browser you're interacting with.

Keep in mind that if you clear cookies and local storage in said browser, you will lose all your tracked progress.
